# Tailwind CSS Learning Project

This repository contains the code for a project where I learned how to use Tailwind CSS following the documentation. The project was initiated using `npx tailwindcss init`, and the path was configured in the `contents` parameter. The project structure includes two main folders, `src` and `dist`.

## Project Structure

- `src`: This folder contains the source code files for the project.
- `dist`: This folder holds the compiled and optimized files that are ready for deployment.

## UI Development Progress

### Beginner UI

- Two distinct cards representing different pricing plans: Start-Up and Enterprise.
- Each card includes essential information about the pricing plan, such as features, pricing details, and a call-to-action button for requesting a demo.
- Styling elements, including gradients, rounded corners, and font-awesome icons, to enhance the visual appeal of the UI.

### Intermediate UI

- A responsive login page design with a background image and a login form.
- Form elements for email and password input, along with a 'Forgot your password?' link.
- Social media icons for quick login via Facebook, Google, and Instagram.
- A 'Sign Up' link for users who do not have an account.

### Advanced UI

- A dynamic and responsive navigation bar with a logo, menu items, and login/signup options.
- A visually appealing header section with engaging text and an illustrative image.
- Brand logos representing companies that trust the service.
- A detailed section describing the benefits and features of the service.
- A free trial section with a call-to-action button and additional information.
- A well-structured footer with company information, navigation links, and social media icons.
