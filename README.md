# Tailwind CSS Learning Project

This repository contains the code for a project where I learned how to use Tailwind CSS following the documentation. The project was initiated using `npx tailwindcss init`, and the path was configured in the `contents` parameter. The project structure includes two main folders, `src` and `dist`.

## Project Structure

- `src`: This folder contains the source code files for the project.
- `dist`: This folder holds the compiled and optimized files that are ready for deployment.

## UI Development Progress

### Beginner UI

In the initial phase, I focused on creating a beginner-friendly UI using Tailwind CSS. This included simple layouts, basic components, and styling elements as per the Tailwind CSS documentation. I explored the core features and utilities of Tailwind CSS to build a foundational understanding of the framework.

### Intermediate UI

Moving forward, I advanced to developing an intermediate-level UI, where I implemented more complex layouts and components. I delved deeper into the customization options provided by Tailwind CSS and experimented with various design patterns and responsive designs.

### Advanced UI

Finally, I worked on an advanced UI, implementing sophisticated design elements, animations, and advanced styling techniques using Tailwind CSS. This phase allowed me to leverage the full potential of Tailwind CSS and create intricate and visually appealing user interfaces.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the development server using `npm start` or the preferred script provided in the `package.json` file.

Feel free to explore the code and the different UI iterations that I have implemented using Tailwind CSS. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
